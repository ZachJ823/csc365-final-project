# Clapboard

Movie logging and tracking application.

Final project for CSC-365.

You'll need to procure your own API key through themoviedb (account required). It will go in `src/components/search.jsx`. I tried working with .env and dotenv but never got it to work without a CORS exception.

## Packages used

- [useLocalStorageState](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state)

- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) if you want to mess with the .env. Again, had some difficulty with it on a local server.
  
## Tooling used

- React and Vite
  
- [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for API provision
